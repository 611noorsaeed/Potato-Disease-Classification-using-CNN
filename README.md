# Overview
Potato cultivation is a crucial aspect of agriculture, and diseases can significantly impact crop yield. This project leverages deep learning techniques, specifically CNNs, to automate the process of identifying and classifying diseases in potato plants. The trained model can be used as a tool for early detection and intervention, helping farmers make informed decisions about crop management.

# CNN Explained
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)
Convolutional Neural Networks are a class of deep neural networks designed for processing grid-like data, such as images. CNNs consist of multiple layers, including convolutional layers, pooling layers, and fully connected layers. These networks are particularly effective in feature extraction and pattern recognition tasks.

For more details on CNNs and their architecture, please refer to the CNN Explained section below.
