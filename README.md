# Potato-Disease-Classification-using-CNN
This project aims to classify diseases in potato plants using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The deep learning model is trained on a dataset of potato plant images to identify and categorize different diseases affecting the crops.


# Overview
Potato cultivation is a crucial aspect of agriculture, and diseases can significantly impact crop yield. This project leverages deep learning techniques, specifically CNNs, to automate the process of identifying and classifying diseases in potato plants. The trained model can be used as a tool for early detection and intervention, helping farmers make informed decisions about crop management.

# CNN Explained
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)
Convolutional Neural Networks are a class of deep neural networks designed for processing grid-like data, such as images. CNNs consist of multiple layers, including convolutional layers, pooling layers, and fully connected layers. These networks are particularly effective in feature extraction and pattern recognition tasks.

# Dataset
dowload (train): https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/muhammadardiputra/potato-leaf-disease-dataset
The dataset used for this project comprises high-resolution images of healthy and diseased potato plants. The dataset is divided into training and testing sets to train and evaluate the CNN model.



# Results
The trained model achieves an accuracy of 99% on the test set. Detailed evaluation metrics and visualizations can be found in the Results notebook.
